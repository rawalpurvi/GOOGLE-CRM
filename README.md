GOOGLE-CRM

I wanted to learn how to add google sign-in button to the application and how to conntect with google API, so I built this small application. The web application of GOOGLE-CRM is built to connect with google's people API to perfrom CRUD operations to the user contacts. Google user can create, update and delete their contacts using this application. This application is using people api to do this operations. This applications runs on python3 and flask. I download md4 bootstrap (https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/b4/) and save into static folder for fronend design.

The GOOGLE-CRM code follows PEP8 style guidelines.

Getting Started

    ## Pre-requisites and Local Development

    Run this application one should have Python3, pip on their local machines.

    Setup ngrok for secure host (https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup) or get SSL for local server.

    ## Get Google credetials

    Follow the steps described in Setup(https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/get-google-api-clientid) to configure your OAuth Consent Screen and to obtain a Client ID.

    Set all enpoints for the application to redirecting from google on `Client ID for Web application`.

    Authorized JavaScript origins (need https or use ngrok):

    https://localhost:8888/login

    https://localhost:8888/login
    https://localhost:8888/user_contact_info
    https://localhost:8888/contacts
 

    Get all the credentials and dwonload credential file on local. 

    Save secret file as `credentials.json` outside the folder to get credential for connection to the google's people api.

    Add test users in your Google cloud application to define which user can login to this applcation.

    Save value as an environment variable. Here are the variable list:

    GOOGLE_SCOPES
    SECRETS_FILE
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID

    ## How to run the application

    Download code and set virual environment to install requirnments with this command:

    source env/bin/activate

    From folder run pip install requirements.txt . All required packages are included in the requirenments file. 

    To run the application run the following commands:

    python3 app.py

    The application is run on http://127.0.0.1:8888/ by default but need to setup ngrok or SSL to run the web app on secure server https.

    In project directory there is one file test.log will store errors generated by the application while running.
